**DropPartyFiesta** is a plugin that adds highly configurable and exciting means of distributing items to players in the form of parties. **Fun** is an important element for players, and what better way but to hype things up with drop parties in a myriad of ways? This plugin supports the following means of throwing drop parties:
- Throw drop party at pre-defined locations (players pick up items shot from locations)
- Throw drop party at player location (players pick up items shot from a player)
- Throw drop party in chat (players click on a message for items)
- Throw drop party with mobs (players attack the mob for items)
- Throw drop party into inventories (items drop into online player inventories)

The plugin also comes with a wide range of configurable options (e.g. `drop-rate`, `delay`, `mob-ai`, `radius`). With a total of 20+ options, you are able to style and setup your drop parties with a great degree of flexibility! The best part? All these configurations can be done via an **in-game UI**! You also have nothing to worry performance wise as the plugin does majority of the heavy tasks asynchronously whenever it is able to!

As this is currently a private project, the code is not open-sourced and I am unable to accept contributions at the moment. Appreciate the thoughts though!
